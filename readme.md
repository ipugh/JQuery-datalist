# A JQuery Implementation of the HTML datalist element

## Usage
The JQuery implementation of the datalist tag is used by
1. Enclose an input element that has a class of "datalist" with a div that has a class of "container"
2. In the given directory (var file in the main.js file) the list of the wanted autofill options are placed, separated with newline characters.

## Frequent Issues
1. In order for the list to properly appear on top of other elements, other items that could be affected should be set to either a relative or absolute position.
2. Due to the Same-origin policy, this code will not work correct locally. Make sure you are using it on a web server.

## Why?
A JQuery Implementation of the html datalist tag was created because currently the datalist tag is not supported in Safari or on mobile devices.

## To Do
- Up/Down arrow keys to move
- Make list disappear synchronously
